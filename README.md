# Oroboros-O2K-Analysis
  Analysis Files for Oroboros Oxygraph O2K. I hold no stake in company and have independently created these files for research purposes.

These files are publicly available for use and feedback. I intend to post these files to streamline the analysis and visualization of O2K data. I welcome any feedback and intend to maintain these files as living documents.

# Excel File
The [excel file](/Excel Analysis/README.md) I have made should allow easy transfer of raw data from DatLab into Excel, where it will be organized to be easily read by R.

# R code
This R code is for fast processing and visualization of Oroboros data. I have only made code that will analyze the protocols I frequently use, however I will be developing more as I develop new protocols.
