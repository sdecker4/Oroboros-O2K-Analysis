# Instructions for the Excel files
Once the [data has been copied from DatLab](/README.md), paste the data into the Excel template 
(either [CHO](
/Excel%20Analysis/Template_CHO_O2K_Analysis.xlsx) or 
[Free Fatty Acid](/Excel%20Analysis/Template_FFA_O2K_Analysis.xlsx)) in the 'Paste Here' section highlighted.

The respiration rates and averaged data should be automatically calculated, along with mass (if input into DatLab).

From here, you will have two tabs that automatically average the values and put them into tables that can be exported for analysis via 
t-tests or ANOVA. This process will be explained in the [R files](/R%20Files), but should also be ready to be copied and pasted into most
available stats packages.
